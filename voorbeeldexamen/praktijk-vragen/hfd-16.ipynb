    "# 1  Generating (Shakespearean) Text with a GPT-like Transformer\n",
    "In this exercise we are going to build a GPT-like transformer. Such a transformeris a decoder-only transformer and hence the doesn’t include a cross attention layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practical application of the transformer, we will train it to generate Shakespearean text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the following video1from Andrej Karpathy explains in detail how to builda GPT-like decoder. In the video the Pytorch framework is used, but the con-cepts are identical. The video also follows the “Attention is all you need” paper,apart from the placement of the `LayerNormalization` layers.The overall architecture of adecoder-only transformeris shown in Figure 1\n",

    "We start by implementing the FeedForward layer. According to equation (2) ofthe “Attention is all you Need” paper, this layer performs the following calcula-tion:\n",

    "FFN(𝑥) =max(0, 𝑥𝑊_1+ 𝑏_1)𝑊_2+ 𝑏_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which is applied to each position (i.e. each time step)𝑥independently. Thedimensions of the input and output are identical, but the layer in between is4times wider.For this exercise, we are going to implement this layer as a subclass ofkeras.layers.Layerbut we willnotuse any other layers, instead you should"
